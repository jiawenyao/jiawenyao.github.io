            <h2>UNKNOWN by YIN Xiuzhen</h2>
            <p>
                UNKNOWN transforms the exigencies of world affairs and flux of
                emotions into constellations of heavenly bodies, in which fleeting human presences catalyze and
                transpire a universe of ephemerality and uncertainty.
                <br>
                <br>
                UNKNOWN by YIN Xiuzhen is the third iteration of the A&T@ Program initiated at Chronus Art Center, and
                another notable outcome of continued collaborations between ZHI and CAC.
                <br>
                <br>
                My role in the team is assisting production of the exhibition from beginning to the end and designing
                the physical parts.

            <h2>Hyper Personal Produce Workshop</h2>

            <p>
                In the workshop each participant are turned into a problem solver for the other individiul. The workshop
                is design to get
                citizen's agency back from Deigners and Markets, also give people access to tool for creating. In this
                workshop, we are managed to escape the
                mass-produced, one-size-fits-all products, but design a product for one individual, and ideally, for
                only THE individual.
                <br>
                <br>
                The workshops were conducted in collaboration with the HIVELABS at the Shanghai West Bund Museum's
                FutureLab 2019 as well as in the Shanghai Theatre Center.
                <br>
                <br>
                The workshops were hosted by me when I was in MorrowAgent studio.

                The paint-like installation will flash and have wired noise when there’s someone calls the number, i.e.
                the title.

                It is consisted of an electromagnetic sensor, a some lights, speakers, a relay and a cell phone. The
                signal received by the sensor will be converted into an audio signal to the speakers, which will also
                control the relay to turn on to a high voltage. Therefore the light will flash with the sound. When a
                call is made to the phone, the noise emitted becomes louder and the lamp flicker becomes more violent
                due to the enhanced electromagnetic wave. People from all over the world can call "harassment" as long
                as they know the phone number.

                Aside from listening to voice commands, the device also 'listens' for unencrypted network communications
                from other artworks in the exhibition.
                Text-based information is spoken aloud, whereas all of the intercepted content is reappropriated on a

                l̶̩͔̻̔e̵͎͆͂̉͋ą̶̲͓̩͛̇k̴̜̠͆̍͌ is ubiquitous, bursting gas, leaking pipes and oozing tears, and so
                ubiquitous that its figurative meaning sounds even more native, circulating gossips are
                l̵̞̗̕è̸͉a̸̧͖̭͍̽͋̈͛k̴̡̤̤͚͂, whistleblowers are, too, l̴͕͎̈́̀͌̍ę̸͖̃å̸̛͈̒̌k̶̥̊̈͘. Metaphorical
                l̷̦̜̈́̌̂͂͘e̸͎͊̚ä̵̱̥̞̖̈́ḱ̸̺̜̩̱̀, inheriting the brokenness from physical l̴̲̆è̴̬a̸̡̒k̸̦̈́, is associated
                with illegality or at least immorality. But, is it?

                In the video essay, l̴͓̥̠̼̏̑̃̂̂͘ḛ̷̺̟͓͈̜̓̋̍̄̆ä̸̞̝̳́̾̓̈̾k̷͎̰̓̒͘ in the promiscuous machines and prurient
                governing entities is brought to the forefront as systemic vulnerabilities. A message you send out to
                your loved one over the the TCP/IP protocol, as Chun noted, is slutty. Audio and video signal cables are
                constantly radiating RF emanations. Buffer overflows when data overwrites, memory leaks when the old
                memory is not released, software ages, like human beings, aging leads to more l̷͚̙͋ė̸̺̅ạ̸̇k̴͈̃̑s. In
                addition to that, our faces are reduced to facial features for machine learning, personal medical
                records end as image embedding in a training dataset. Our voices leak as analyzable waves, irises leak
                as unique high-contrast photographs. We, as users and as citizens, are encouraged by the tech giants and
                governments to leak, while the large language models trained from the data we leaked, refuse to
                “participate in or encourage any illegal activities, including leaking.”

                pipe, the space station, the express warehouse, into the leaking signals, leaky compression algorithms,
                leaky network packets, leaked tiny face and tiny activity dataset, to ask who is making it’s not ok to
                l̵͚̗̠͋̀͘é̴̮̲á̶̜̊k̶̥̎̓̒͊, who is capturing l̴͊̈́ͅe̵̜̞̐ȧ̷͇k̶̫̮̓, how l̸̯̏e̷̙̅a̷̛̗̔͐k̸̫͈̓̀ is weaponized
                and who is killing ḷ̶̢̓́́e̶̼̅̾a̴̟͆k̸̖͑̎́ to stop solidarity from happening.

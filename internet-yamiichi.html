            <h2>tenretnI >>Internet Yami Ichi booth</h2>
            <p>2019</p>
            <p>
                My booth sells four items in the Internet Yami Ichi at Chronus Art
                Center (CAC), Shanghai. They are Earbo, 404 bracelets, a real life
                Follower and some Dopamine data.

        <div class="img-post-big">

            <p>> Earbo </p>
            <p>
                Earbo is a decentralized non-censorship wearable microblogging and
                social networking service on which users post messages through
                bluetooth. You Are What You Say.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="img-post-medium">
            <img class="medium-img" src="imgs/yamiichi/b404.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>> 404 Bracelets</p>
            <p>
                Numbers on the 404 bracelets are invalid proxy IP addresses, which
                once carried their users through the Great Firewall in the mainland
                Chinese context.
            </p>
            <p>
                The uniqueness of a certain IP address also makes that bracelet
                unique. And, when all the IPv4 addresses are used up in the near
                future, these bracelets will also become a testimony of the good old
                days.
            </p>

        <div class="img-post-medium">
            <img class="medium-img" src="imgs/yamiichi/following.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>> A Follower</p>
            <p>
                Buy a real life Follower with a little bit of your privacy — your
                phone number and your home address —then I will follow you IRL
                someday.

            <p>> Dopamine Data</p>
            <p>Three anonymous Tinder users would like to sell their tinder usage
                data claimed from Tinder.</p>
            <p>
                The data includes daily counts of app opening, left swiping and right
                swiping, matches, the amount of message sent, and received.
            </p>
            <p>
                I made a glowing pink vending interface for them, customers can pay
                and get a receipt-like printed data sheet.
            </p>

                my booth is also collected in the book <span><a href="https://yami-ichi.download/">A DECADE TO DOWNLOAD</a></span>, which is

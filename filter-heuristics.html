                Dirty data refers to data that is somewhat faulty and requires to be removed in data preprocessing. In
                1980s, non-white women’s body size data was categorized as dirty data, now, in the age of GPT, when
                “scale-up” first is the golden rule, when researchers/engineers scraping the internet to get as much
                free data as possible, what is considered as dirty data and how are they removed from massive training
                materials?

                The publication looks into 17 open (or reproduced thus open) extraction-based, human-not-in-the-loop
                datasets and gathers their heuristic-based methods for filtering out dirty data. A heuristic is a
                practical method that, not guaranteed to be optimal, perfect, or rational, but is “good enough” solving
                the problem at hand. This publication questions whether a narrative of “cleaning” can emerge from
                technical papers, reflecting on these silent, anonymous yet upheld estimations and not-guaranteed
                rationalities in current sociotechnical artifacts, and on for whom these estimations are good-enough, as
                it will soon be part our technological infrastructures.

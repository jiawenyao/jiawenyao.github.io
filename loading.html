        Delivery service is being advertised as seamless, as the vans that
        magically bring online orders, which exist primarily as a state of desire
        before arriving, only hours after purchase to doorsteps. The vast network
        of infrastructures, technologies, physical spaces, workers, and violence
        that makes the circulation of goods possible remains tucked out of sight
        for us who engage with logistics only as consumers. The existence of the
        logistics is similar to the rotating loading icon on a web browser, as
        users, this process is defined as too laborious for us to figure out
        what's going on inside the optical fibers and on highways.

        This analogy can be extended further. The first internet protocol was
        developed through the physical act of driving on the open road (Ant Farm
        media van). The vans were traveling between nodes(truckstop network) and
        becoming packets just as packets shuttle through fiber optics. There are
        over 5 million packets being delivered daily in Germany, however, these
        vans, drivers and packets are in the opposite of an open-world.

        This project tries to present the detours, the human & machine labor, and
        the undesired state of existence of a tediously verbose, 24-hour operating
        process as visible as the arriving of a package, through turning the
        packets and vans again as the media, the process the data/content, the
        motion the destination.

    <p class="me">
      Jiawen Yao is an inter-human-tech designer.
      <br>
      <br>
      She loves the physical world more than the digital one, and she’s not content experiencing the world through small rectangle screens. So she’s trying to meld these two together in her work.
      <br>
      <br>
      She draws her design inspirations from those uneasy and doubtful moments interacting with technology or other human beings. She presents those moments as her work in a speculative or playful way.

        <p class="cap">about</p>
        <p>
          ge:odel is a package of tangible controllers that enable children to learn geometry from the perspective of 3D modeling.
          Children will get a random 3D/2D shape and can use the extrude controller, transform controller and perspective controller, also work collaboratively to change its shape, and experience the flexible transformation of geometry.
          <br>
          <br>
      </p>
          <p class="cap">why</p>
          <p>
            As a designer, a new window of seeing shapes was open when I started learning 3D modeling software. A entity can be extruded from a flat surface, a surface can be extended from a line, and a line can be from a dot originally. Also, the
            difference of building a triangle or a circle is that barely how many sides you use, with polygons as transitions, which rocked my world.
<br>
            <br>
           The wonderfulness and the in-depth association among geometry shapes should be presented to children, including who are not going to learn professional 3D modeling software.
            <br>
            <br>
        This project also explores the opportunity that how tangibles interactive screenless toys can be alternatives of screen devices which have became a major concern of parents.

        <h2>Lemusade</h2>
        <p class="cap">about</p>
        <p>
          Lemusade is a self-service lemonade mixer box that encouraging people to make their cooking decisions based on audio cues rather than visual feedback.
          The mixing starts with a base melody. When adding different ingredients, the melody changes correspondingly which indicting the “flavor” of the lemonade.
          <br>
          <br>
        </p>
          <p class="cap">why</p>
          <p>
            Lemusade is an exploration of synesthesia and metaphor. In language level, we use same/similar words to describe music and flavor: “This song’s so SWEET!”, “It sounds a bit too DRY for me!”. With this metaphor that already embedded in
            our mind, is it possible for our audio senses guide us as sufficiently as visual cues to create food tastes of our choice? By mapping the ingredients’ “flavor” to music “flavor” based on previous research, we provided users to view food
            and the process of cooking from a new perspective.

        <h2>HS Amplifier</h2>
        <p class="cap">about</p>
        <p>
          HS Amplifier is an installation displaying one speaker’s heart sounds with the flipping of the glass marble during a conversation. I want to
          explore if the ambient background sound of one speaker’s heartbeats would make the conversation easier or harder for the speaker himself/herself? What about for the other one? Would it make the speaker more true to his/her heart whiling
          speaking? Would it build a deeper understanding between both sides?
          <br>
          <br>
        </p>
          <p class="cap">why</p>
          <p>
            It is a rather personal project.
            <br>
            <br>
            Either in the Asian culture I grew up, or as a female in a intimate relationship, I tend to hide up a part of myself and expect the other to do the mind-reading or to hear the unspoken words from what I said. Can I have a medium that can speak for the hidden part of me and be more honest than me myself?
            <br>
            <br>
            My personal experience with the HS Amplifier is that I would speak like speaking through a speaker that attached to a polygraph and an interpreter. For one thing, I would try to make sure that what I’m saying is what I’m thinking because otherwise my heart sounds is going to say this. For another, it seems like I’m having an unreliable interpreter. Sometime I count on it to express myself throughly but sometimes I doubt if the other can feel what i’m feeling through the interpret.

        <h2>Emotion ownership</h2>
        <p>
          This is a design fiction about the future of emotional biosensing, affective computing and emotion ownership. Inspired by <a class="link" href="http://nourahowell.com/" target="_blank">Noura Howell</a> et al. <a class="link" href="http://nourahowell.com/projects/emotional_biosensing.html" target="_blank">Emotional Biosensing: Exploring Critical Alternatives</a>.
          <br>
          <br>
          When all the emotions are identified, tracked and “accurately” represented, who would be the owner of emotions?
        </p>


        <div class="contents story">
          <img src="imgs/emotion/emo1.png"/>
          <p>In 2042, a perfect emotion model has been found, with 100% accurate and computable, 0 ambiguity. </p>
          <img src="imgs/emotion/emo2.png"/>
          <p>With emotions being transparent, it prevents suicide effectively.</p>
          <img src="imgs/emotion/emo3.png"/>
          <p>Emotion Stability is regarded more “official” than age. Most events require ES 200&up rather than age over 21 any more.</p>
          <img src="imgs/emotion/emo4.png"/>
          <p>It's an era of IoE(Internet of Emotions). Emotion sensitive technology makes that the brightness of your lamp, the music style of your playlist, the selfie filters, the color of your shirts and nails are all connected to your emotion center, and are designed to be real-time responsive. Also you can share all your “tangible” emotions with your friends.</p>

          <p>With the example of shirts, …</p>
          <img src="imgs/emotion/emo6.png"/>
          <p>When shirt’s color changes are regarded as social responses, people get more sincere than ever.<br>
            But awkward situations can happen, when your shirt is saying the opposite of what you are saying, which one do you believe? yourself or your shirt? which one does your friend believe? <br><br>
            To avoid this awkwardness…</p>
          <img src="imgs/emotion/emo7.png"/>
          <p>you, as well as thousands of others, have to take the emotion control course.<br>
            The course doesn’t only teach you how to control your emotions, but how to keep up with your shirt responses! <br><br>And finally…</p>

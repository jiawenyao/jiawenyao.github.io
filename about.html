        jiawen(she/they) exists as a user most of the time in her life, having little agency as a standard user, both tech and
        politic wise, she seeks for otherwise possibilities queering the given identity of a user, her wish is to be an
        analogkäse in the digital figurations and drip sizzling fat on the cables and ports. Apart from that, jiawen is
        a researcher-designer based in Bremen, Germany. Her research interest lies in technology’s (counter)history, materiality, poetics and politics. she sees
        l̸͓̪̜͕̮̆̎̓e̷͍̲͕̫̦͌a̵̡̝͈̗̐k̴̢͖̮̞̣̄͛̓͛̐ as a definite part of the digital reality, and leaking as a method to
        survive together. Recently, she’s working on a publication of gathering filtering heuristics from datasets used
        for LLM, to look into the erasions and erosions and to extract an narrative of uncontextualized dirty-shaming.

        jiawen exists as a user most of the time in their life, having little agency as a standard user, both technologically and politically, she seeks for otherwise possibilities for queering the given identity of a user, their wish is to be an analogkäse in the digital figurations and drip sizzling fat on the cables and ports.
        <br>
        <br>
        apart from that, jiawen's research focuses on technology as memory and desire, with contaminated history but appearing pure, sterilized, decontextualized and dehistoricized, reducing rather than relating. jiawen looks into the (counter)history, materiality, poetics and politics of technology. She sees l̸͓̪̜͕̮̆̎̓e̷͍̲͕̫̦͌a̵̡̝͈̗̐k̴̢͖̮̞̣̄͛̓͛̐ as an instance of the space-time continuum and a definite part of the digital reality, and leaking as a method to survive together.

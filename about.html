        jiawen(they/she) exists as a user most of the time in their life, having little agency as a standard user, both technology and politic wise, she seeks for otherwise possibilities queering the given identity of a user, their wish is to be an analogkäse in the digital figurations and drip sizzling fat on the cables and ports.
        <br>
        <br>
        apart from that, jiawen's research focus on technology as memory and desire, with contaminated history but appearing pure, sterilized, decontextualized and dehistoricized which reduces rather than relating. jiawen looks into technology’s micro-(counter)history, materiality, poetics and politics. She sees l̸͓̪̜͕̮̆̎̓e̷͍̲͕̫̦͌a̵̡̝͈̗̐k̴̢͖̮̞̣̄͛̓͛̐ as an instance of space-time continuum and a definite part of the digital reality, and leaking as a method to survive together.

        currently based in Bremen, Germany.

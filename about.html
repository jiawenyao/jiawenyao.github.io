        jiawen exists as a user most of the time in her life, having little agency as a standard user, both technology
        and politic wise, she seeks for otherwise possibilities queering the given identity of a user, her wish is to be
        an analogkäse in the digital figurations and drip sizzling fat on the cables and ports.
        <br>
        <br>
        Apart from that, jiawen is a researcher-designer based in Bremen, Germany, her research focus on technology as
        memory and desire, with contaminated history but appearing pure, sterilized, decontextualized and dehistoricized
        which reduces rather than relating. She looks into technology’s micro(counter)history, materiality, poetics and
        politics. She sees l̸͓̪̜͕̮̆̎̓e̷͍̲͕̫̦͌a̵̡̝͈̗̐k̴̢͖̮̞̣̄͛̓͛̐ as an instance of space-time continuum and a definite
        part of the digital reality, and leaking as a method to survive together.
